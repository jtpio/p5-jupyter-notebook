    "## Concrete example with the Bermuda Triangle Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bermuda Triangle Puzzle is a wooden puzzle consisting of 1 big triangle and 16 smaller triangles of equal size.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the edges of the big triangle, there are colored dots, as well as on the edges of the small triangles:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bermuda Triangle Puzzle](./img/bermuda_triangle_puzzle.jpg)"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The 16 triangles all fit inside the big triangle. But the goal of the puzzle is to **arrange the triangles in a way so that each adjacent color is the same: red next to red, blue next to blue, and so on...**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to notice is that the colors on the edges of the big triangle cannot be moved, but the smaller triangles can be rotated and re-arranged as we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we solve this?\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, there are different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One can just take the puzzle and start playing with it. After a while, some patterns may show up but it can become very tedious when trying all combinations.\n",
    "2. Speaking of trying all combinations, it is also possible to brute force the puzzle manually with the wooden pieces, take notes of the configurations that have been tested, and keep iterating. This requires a lot of rigor to not miss any step and start from the beginning.\n",
    "3. Brute-forcing can be fun for a moment, but repetitive after a few minutes. Instead of doing it manually, we write a program that goes through all possibilities and try them one by one, maybe finding more than one solution if more exist. This requires knowing how to approach the problem and define an explicit and efficient search strategy, which can be difficult to find and implement.\n",
    "4. When we don't really know what to do, we can start modelling the puzzle / state, and use stochastic search to find a solution. This requires a set of good building blocks and tools that the stochastic search can rely on. You can find examples of using Simulated Annealing on my [blog](https://jtp.io) to solve the [Aristotle Number Puzzle](https://jtp.io/2017/01/12/aristotle-number-puzzle.html) and the [Nine-Color Cube](https://jtp.io/2017/05/10/nine-color-cube.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why a custom visualization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this problem can be solved without having to create any graphics, the output can be very rudimentary. Basically a list of triangles in a given order. And that's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without visualization, it can be difficult to verify the correctness of the solution and understand what is happening under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the whole purpose of this section: being able to solve the problem in Python and visualize the solution, all without leaving the notebook!"

    "In this notebook, we will go with the third approach, using a recursive search.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since we will already be drawing the puzzle, we can push one step further to make an interactive animation of the search.\n",

    "Steps:\n",

    "2. Define a function, which draws a state on a canvas. A state is defined as the big triangle and a permutation of the 16 small triangles potentially rotated.\n",
    "3. Define a function, which given a list of actions (permutations of triangles, rotation of triangles), animate them on a canvas.\n",
    "5. Define a function that uses the helper to search for the solution, logging each step taken (permutation, rotation) to a list of actions.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we managed to combine all the core strengths of Javascript, Python and the Jupyter Notebook to create a custom and interactive walkthrough of the resolution of a puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core logic and the resolution of the problem can be implemented in Python. On the other hand the rendering and visual feedback can be delegated to Javascript (which excels at it), making once again the best out of the tools at our disposition.\n",
    "Finally, the Jupyter Notebook acts as the glue between the two worlds especially thanks to the wonderful Jupyter Widget library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What have we learned?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to create a Jupyter Widget on the fly in the Jupyter Notebook, and use is to transfer data between Python and Javascript\n",
    "2. Use p5.js to create a custom animation in HTML5 and Javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Such interactive notebooks and the possibility to leverage existing Javascript frameworks can be used in many applications: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual debugging, or visually understanding a complex system\n",
    "- Teaching and education\n",
    "- Combine HTML5 / Javascript games with data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the end result is quite satisfying, there are a couple of things that can be improved for this workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The setup code and the animations were tailored for this specific problem and not really designed with reusability in mind. One could built a mini-libraries of such helper functions on the side that can be imported in the notebook (as Python packages or as a packaged Jupyter Widget).\n",
    "- Does it work in JupyterLab? For [security reasons](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3118), JupyterLab prevents the execution of Javascript code in a cell (basically what we did in the entire notebook). The way to go with JupyterLab would be to package the widget and deliver it as a proper extension. A much cleaner and production ready strategy than writing everything on the fly in a notebook!\n",
    "- Depending on where you run the notebook, and most importantly on where the kernel is run, you might notice some jitter and latency in the animation. This is due to the round trip between the client (web browser) and the server (Python kernel), and is further explained in the documentation: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Events.html?highlight=link#Linking-widgets-attributes-from-the-client-side. Depending on the application it might or might not be a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "\n",
    "I underwent quite a lot of research to find an existing library that would fit my needs (low level rendering to draw custom shapes, with interactivity). There are already some projects implementing similar use cases, but all still specific in some way. Here is a list of useful references for a more advanced understanding of the entire ecosystem and know where the Jupyter Widgets fit on the overall picture:\n",
